            <h1>Mindashq</h1>
            <p>Mindashq is a CSS Theme designed to be used on any subreddit with minimal modifications. </p>

            <p>It takes just <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/mindashq/wiki/index#wiki_two_step_setup">two steps</a> to have a well designed reddit experience with Mindashq.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Distinct header and footer</strong> :A light and roomy top area, and a matching footer to go with it. The local subreddit name is seen very prominent in header for easy identification and is super intuitive for clicking. The header handles all sizes of images and logos, and keeps them in true-to-reddit format (header logo links to reddit.com homepage) and looks sleek without compromising the space.</li>
                <li><strong>Compact and Crisp</strong> : The comments, the sidebar, the links posts and all the pages (wiki, search, related pages, submit page and all) are done in a way to avoid nested boxes, borders are removed (free world) and distinctions are handled without compromising the reddit defaults.</li>
                <li><strong>Readability improvements</strong> : Minimal borders and breaks to give a nice reading experience. The buttons change colors based on context. The "Reply" button on comments is more prominent to make replying to a comment more obvious (rather than hiding the submit link/text buttons)</li>
                <li><strong>100% text-only</strong> theme, no images required for the standard theme. Even the voting arrows are theme-based and manageable for color changes without having to  depend on images.</li>
                <li><strong>Modular CSS</strong> for controlled and easy to manage changes with opt-in modules (custom css code) and images as needed. There are no images added by the theme, only the images that would be needed as per the subreddit customization.</li>
                <li>All areas (moderator, user pages, and settings pages) also accounted for. This makes the base theme suitable for use with stylish, or stylebot across reddits (Works perfectly with Stylish for Google Chrome).</li>
                <li><a href="http://redditenhancementsuite.com/">RES compatible</a> (top bar, never ending reddit, night-mode full support, fixed header, custom buttons on links/posts/comments).</li>
                <li>Works with <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/reddit-companion/algjnflpgoopkdijmkalfcifomdhmcbe">Reddit Companion for Chrome</a>
